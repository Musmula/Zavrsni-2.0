Zippy is a file sharing platform designed to transfer files from one computer to another without the transfer of any sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.
## Process
When you drop your files into the dropzone on the homepage, they’re uploaded through asynchronous POST requests protected with a CSRF token and TLS. They’re then temporarily stored on a server in Frankfurt, waiting for you to confirm that you’re done uploading and ready to zip them up. Once you do that, a zip archive spawns on the server containing your files. The originals are deleted at that moment. If you upload files without zipping them, they’ll stay on the server for a day, unaccessible to the public, you won’t be able to recover them.
## But why?
I created Zippy because it solves a specific problem I had in school. The computers in my school have poor security implementations and all of them are compromised with malware. When a task required me to use one of those computers, I needed a way to transfer my work from them without connecting them in any way with my personal devices or using them to write out sensitive information (becasuse most of them are infected with keyloggers). So the solution is to upload the results of my work to Zippy, scan the QR code with my phone and submit it or the zip file to my teacher.
## Development
Zippy is on GitHub and I’m open to suggestions and pull requests. Don’t be shy if you have an idea or even better: the execution of your idea in a fork.
### Installation
Once you've cloned the repo, run
```bash
composer install
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```
You'll also need to configure your database and input the credentials into the .env file. Once you've got that covered, you just run
```bash
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan storage:link
php artisan serve
```
And you should have a running instance of Zippy at localhost:8000
### House cleaning artisan commands
Zippy includes 3 custom commands. One for deleting old archives and db records, one for clearing the uploads folder and one that wrapps the other two together and calls them between maintenance toggles.
```bash
php artisan clear:archives
php artisan clear:uploads
php artisan clear:all
```
If the .env file says that the app is in production, only archives older than a week will be deleted but if you're in a local environment, everything gets dropped.
The scheduler calls ```clear:all``` daily at 4, but in order to make use of that you need to either configure cron jobs or set up scheduling in Laravel Forge.
### Basic Google Analytics integration
I've added a conditional partial to the layout file that gets loaded if you set a ```GA``` key in the .env file, like
```
APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

APP_ID=123456789123456
GA=UA-12345678-9
```
### SEO
To do some Basic SEO, there's a conditional seo partial containing some schema.org ld javascript. To set up SEO, add a SEO key to the .env file and set it to true
